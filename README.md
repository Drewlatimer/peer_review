Peer Review Workflow

Login to Perseids.

From the Perseids home screen open your treebank annotation.

Open the first sentence of your treebank.

The url (web address) in your browser should end in a 5 digit number. Write that number down.

Ask the person you are peer-reviewing for their 5 digit number.

Take this template: services2.perseids.org/llt/treebank/diff/html?backend=perseids&reviewable[]=XXXXX&gold=YYYYY and replace the X’s with their 5 digit number and the Ys with your 5 digit number.

Paste the url you created from the template into your browser.

You will see a screen that says something like “LTT Review” “Publication by John Doe against Publication by Jane Doe.” Click on the link.

Click “view in Arethusa” under the first sentence.

You can now see the tree you are reviewing as normal and your tree as a point of reference in the side panel. From this screen you can compare your trees. Write down the url (web address) of a sentence comparison so that you can return to this comparison later.

As an example, try this link: http://services2.perseids.org/llt/treebank/diff/html?backend=perseids&reviewable[]=12245&gold=23529
